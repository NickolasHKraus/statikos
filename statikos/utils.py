    Remove a file or directory.

    *From the BSD General Commands Manual*:
    The rm utility attempts to remove the non-directory type files specified on
    the command line.

    -d    Attempt to remove directories as well as other types of files.

    -f    Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation.

    -R    Attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument.
          The -R option implies the -d option.

    -r    Equivalent to -R.

    This function attempts to emulate the `rm -rf` command.
